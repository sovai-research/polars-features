# PanelFrame

`panelary.core.panel_frame` defines **`PanelFrame`**, the type every other part of Panelary
speaks. A *panel* is a long-format table indexed by an **entity** (a security, a customer, a
country) and a **time** axis; each row is one observation of one entity at one time, and the
remaining columns are features.

`PanelFrame` is a **view**, not a container. It wraps a `polars.LazyFrame` and remembers which
column is the entity and which is the time. It never copies data and stays lazy until you call
`collect()`. Construction validates only the *schema* — that both key columns exist, are
distinct, and that the time column has an orderable dtype — so wrapping a frame is cheap
enough to do freely.

Read the leakage contract precisely: **a `PanelFrame` guarantees the keys are valid; it does
not by itself prevent look-ahead.** What it provides is the machinery that makes leak-safety
expressible and checkable — `over_entity()` for within-entity work, `sort_panel()` for
deterministic ordering, and a remembered `(entity_col, time_col)` pair so every downstream
transform, splitter and verifier agrees on what "the past" means without being told again.

## What's here

| Your problem | Entry point |
| --- | --- |
| Wrap a frame, declaring its keys | `PanelFrame(data, entity=..., time=...)` |
| Accept "a frame or a panel" in your own API | `as_panel` |
| Which columns are keys, which are features? | `entity_col`, `time_col`, `feature_cols`, `columns`, `schema` |
| Per-entity computation in time order | `over_entity`, `group_by_entity` |
| Deterministic `(entity, time)` ordering | `sort_panel`, `is_sorted_per_entity` |
| Inspect the panel's axes | `entities`, `n_entities`, `time_index` |
| Assert one row per `(entity, time)` | `assert_unique_keys` |
| Lazy frame operations, keys preserved | `select`, `with_columns`, `filter`, `pipe` |
| Drop back to Polars | `collect`, `lazy`, `to_frame`, `to_native` |
| Single-key accessors | `entity`, `time` |

## Why a view and not a subclass

Subclassing `polars.LazyFrame` would make every Polars method silently return the wrong type
and would couple Panelary to Polars internals. Wrapping instead keeps one rule: operations that
*preserve* the panel contract (`select`, `with_columns`, `filter`, `pipe`, `sort_panel`) return
a `PanelFrame` with the keys carried through, and operations that leave the panel world
(`collect`, `to_native`) hand you plain Polars. `validate=False` exists for the internal case of
re-wrapping a frame whose keys were already checked.

## Stability

`PanelFrame` is **not** marked experimental in the source; the only "experimental" marker in
the repository is a historical line in `CHANGELOG.md` under `[0.2.0]` (`Added — panel core
(shipped in-repo, experimental)`), describing when the panel core first landed in a release
that was never published to PyPI. That said, Panelary is still `0.x`: the constructor contract
above (entity/time validation, laziness, `feature_cols`) is settled and widely depended on
internally, but no formal stability guarantee applies before `1.0.0`.
