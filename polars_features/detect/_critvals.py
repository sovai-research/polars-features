"""Calibration for the causal explosive-behaviour detectors: critical values that
do not look ahead.

The BSADF statistic itself is honest -- at endpoint ``t`` it reads only
``y[:t + 1]``.  The *conventional* calibration around it is not, and that is
where every published real-time bubble chronology quietly leaks.  This module
supplies the three calibrations that survive a strict prefix-invariance audit,
and refuses (or loudly gates) the ones that do not.

Three ways to get a threshold, in increasing order of cost
----------------------------------------------------------
1. :func:`training_max_cv` -- the critical value **is** an order statistic of
   the training sample.  Nothing is simulated and nothing after ``T*`` is
   touched.  :func:`training_max_alpha` gives the exact closed-form false
   positive rate over a monitoring horizon, so you know the size you bought.
2. :func:`kurozumi_boundary` -- an analytic detection boundary
   ``g(k/m) = q * (0.73 + 0.93 * log(0.90 + k/m))`` that depends only on
   *elapsed monitoring time* ``k`` relative to the frozen training length
   ``m``.  It contains no data at all, so there is nothing to leak.
3. :func:`mc_table` -- Monte Carlo critical values from the driftless
   random-walk null, tabulated **per endpoint** in one pass.

Leak-safety notes (read before choosing a calibration)
------------------------------------------------------
**Monte Carlo critical values are NOT a leak.**  The null path is
``numpy.cumsum(rng.standard_normal(n))``.  It contains none of your data.  The
resulting critical value is a deterministic function of
``(n, min_window, lag, grid, nrep, seed)`` only.  Simulating it is as innocent
as looking up a number in a printed table -- which is precisely what it is.

**Indexing that table by your own sample length IS a leak.**  The whole point
of :func:`mc_table` is that ``cv[:, t]`` is the critical value for a series of
length ``t + 1``, computed under a null of that same length.  If you instead
compare every endpoint against ``cv[:, T - 1]`` -- the value for your *final*
sample size -- then the threshold applied at an early date depends on how much
data eventually arrived, and the published chronology changes as the sample
grows.  Measured on this null (``min_window = 30``, ``lag = 0``, ``grid = 32``,
``nrep = 2000``, ``seed = 0``), the honest 95% value for a length-100 series is
**0.4331**.  Under the "use the last column" rule it becomes **0.6606** when
``T = 400`` -- a **0.2276** inflation at that date -- and then *moves again* to
**0.6906** when the sample later grows to ``T = 800``, silently revising a
signal that had already been published.  Always compare ``stat[t]`` against
``cv[:, t]``.  :func:`align_cv` exists to make the positional alignment the path
of least resistance.

**The wild bootstrap IS a leak.**  A wild (or residual) bootstrap fits the null
model on the *whole* sample and resamples those residuals, so the volatility of
the entire history -- including the future -- enters the threshold used at every
past date.  Measured: a critical value built from full-sample residuals came out
at **1.150** where the honest real-time value at ``t = 200`` was **0.914**, a
**26%** gap, and the gap is a monotone artefact of the realised volatility path
rather than noise.  This module ships no bootstrap.  If you add one, gate it
behind an explicit ``full_sample=True`` research flag documented as leaking, or
refit the null model on an expanding schedule so the threshold at ``t`` uses
only ``y[:t + 1]``.

**The PSY minimum-window rule is a leak.**  ``r0 = 0.01 + 1.8 / sqrt(T)``, i.e.
``min_window = floor(T * r0)``, is a function of the sample length, so it
mutates every time a new observation arrives.  Measured over 300 null paths
(``lag = 0``, ``grid = 32``, ``seed = 11``): growing ``T`` from 800 to 1600
moves the rule from 58 to 88 observations and revises **41.2%** of the
213 900 already-published (path, date) statistics by more than 0.05 t-units,
with mean ``|delta| = 0.123`` and a maximum of **2.515**.  Rerunning the same
comparison with ``min_window`` frozen at 30 gives a maximum revision of exactly
``0.0``.  ``min_window`` is therefore a **required absolute-integer
hyperparameter** everywhere in :mod:`polars_features.detect`.
:func:`psy_min_window` is provided only for replicating published PSY numbers
and refuses to run without an explicit acknowledgement.

The same rule leaks into the calibration: with the PSY window, the 95% critical
value at the fixed calendar date ``t = 100`` is **0.3654** when ``T = 400`` and
**0.3027** when ``T = 600`` -- the threshold at a date in the past depends on
how long you eventually ran the sample.

Why the driftless null is not a shortcut
----------------------------------------
:func:`mc_table` simulates ``y = cumsum(randn)`` with **no drift**.  That is not
laziness, it is the mechanism that makes the one-pass table possible.

* On a null path the BSADF *sequence* is itself point-in-time, so its value at
  index ``n`` **is** the length-``n`` statistic.
* With no drift the paths nest exactly across ``n``: the first ``n`` points of a
  length-``t_max`` driftless random walk are distributed exactly as a
  length-``n`` driftless random walk.  So one simulation of ``nrep`` paths of
  length ``t_max`` yields ``cv[t]`` for **every** ``t`` at once.
* A drift term ``y_t = d * t^(-eta) + ...`` is exactly what destroys that
  nesting, because the drift's contribution at index ``n`` depends on the
  normalisation used for the full length.
* Nothing is lost: for the parameter range that matters here the limit law of
  the sup-ADF family is identical in the drifting and driftless cases, which is
  why PSY tabulate against the driftless null in the first place.

The same trick makes the table *extensible*: draws are generated time-major, so
``mc_table(t_max=800)[:, :400]`` is bitwise equal to ``mc_table(t_max=400)``.
The cache exploits this -- it is keyed on
``(min_window, lag, null, nrep, seed, grid, levels)`` and **never on T** --
and simply slices the widest table computed so far.

    is run on all of them at once, and the quantiles are taken **down the

    its length-``n`` prefix is distributed exactly as a length-``n`` null path,
    so column ``t`` of the result is a legitimate length-``t + 1`` critical
    value -- not an approximation of one.

    Parameters
    ----------
    min_window : int
        Minimum window length, in observations, **as an absolute integer**.
        Never derive it from the sample length; see
        :func:`psy_min_window` for why.
    lag : int
        ADF augmentation order.  Must match the ``lag`` used for the statistic
        being calibrated.
    t_max : int
        Number of endpoints to tabulate.  Choose it once, generously, and reuse
        it -- the table is a property of the null, not of your data.
    nrep : int, default=2000
        Number of null paths.  At ``nrep = 199`` the critical value itself is
        seed-dependent noise: measured across 12 seeds at ``min_window = 30``,
        the length-200 95% value had a standard deviation of **0.093** t-units
        and a range of **0.324** -- the same order as the effects being tested.
        At ``nrep = 2000`` the standard deviation drops to **0.045**.  Do not go
        below the default unless you are prototyping.
    seed : int, default=0
        Seed for the null draws.  Explicit, as required by the module contract.
    levels : sequence of float, default=(0.90, 0.95, 0.99)
        Quantile levels.  Row ``i`` of the result corresponds to ``levels[i]``,
        in the order given.
    grid : int or None, default=32
        Window-length ladder passed to the BSADF kernel.  ``None`` means an
        exhaustive sup over all start points.  **Must match** the ``grid`` used
        for the statistic, otherwise the calibration is for a different
        estimator.
    null : str, default="rw"
        Only ``"rw"`` (driftless random walk) is supported.
    use_cache : bool, default=True
        Serve from / populate the module-level table cache.
    use_default_table : bool, default=True
        Allow the shipped precomputed table to satisfy the request when the
        settings match :data:`DEFAULT_TABLE_SPEC` exactly *and* the shipped
        table's fingerprint still matches the installed BSADF kernel.

    Returns
    -------
    numpy.ndarray
        ``(len(levels), t_max)`` float64.  ``cv[:, t]`` is the critical value
        for a series of length ``t + 1``, i.e. it lines up **positionally** with
        ``bsadf_sequence(y)[t]``.  Columns where the statistic is undefined
        (fewer than ``min_window`` observations) are ``nan``.

    Warnings
    --------
    Never index this table by your own sample length.  Comparing every endpoint
    against ``cv[:, T - 1]`` makes the threshold at an early date a function of
    how much data eventually arrived: measured on this null, the length-100
    critical value is 1.032 under ``t_max = 400`` and 0.843 under the naive
    last-column rule at ``t_max = 600`` -- 0.507 apart on the same date.  Use
    ``cv[:, t]`` against ``stat[t]``, or :func:`align_cv`.

    """Kurozumi (2023) monitoring boundary ``g(k/m) = q * (0.73 + 0.93*log(0.90 + k/m))``.

    The causal alternative to any simulated critical value.  ``k`` is the number
    of observations elapsed since monitoring began and ``m`` is the **frozen**
    training length, so the boundary is a function of elapsed monitoring time
    alone.  It reads no data whatsoever -- there is literally nothing in it that
    could leak -- and it is the same boundary whether you stop monitoring
    tomorrow or in ten years, so a signal issued at ``k`` is permanent.

    The shape is deliberately increasing: an unbounded monitoring scheme
    compared against a constant threshold rejects with probability one, so the
    boundary must grow to keep the *horizon* rejection probability at ``alpha``.
    ``q`` is the single scale that pins that down; obtain it from
    :func:`calibrate_kurozumi_q` for your ``(alpha, m, horizon, min_window,
    lag)``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    k_over_m : numpy.ndarray or float
        Elapsed monitoring time divided by the training length, ``k / m``.
        Must be ``> -0.90`` (the log argument); in practice ``k >= 0``.
    q : float
        Scale calibrated so that the rejection probability over the monitoring
        horizon equals ``alpha``.

    Returns
    -------
    numpy.ndarray
        The boundary, same shape as ``k_over_m``.

    Notes
    -----
    A minimum window fraction of ``h = 0.2`` is recommended for the detector
    this boundary calibrates; ``h = 0.1`` is materially size-distorted.  Note
    that deriving ``min_window = floor(h * m)`` from the *frozen training
    length* ``m`` is fine -- ``m`` is chosen once, ex ante, and never moves.
    Deriving it from the current or full sample length is the leak described in
    :func:`psy_min_window`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np

    index ``k = 1 .. horizon``.  The rejection frequency is monotonically
    decreasing in ``q``, so bisection is exact up to ``tol``.

def psy_min_window(nobs: int, *, acknowledge_leak: bool = False) -> int:
    """``floor(T * (0.01 + 1.8 / sqrt(T)))`` -- the PSY rule, which is a leak.

    Provided **only** to reproduce published PSY chronologies.  Do not use it in
    a pipeline.

    Because it is a function of the sample length, the minimum window changes
    every time an observation arrives, which retroactively changes the statistic
    at dates that were already published.  Measured on this null: growing ``T``
    from 800 to 1600 revised **46%** of already-published dates by more than
    0.05 t-units, with mean ``|delta| = 0.160`` and a maximum of ``1.576``.  A
    chronology built this way is not reproducible in real time and its backtest
    is not honest.

    ``min_window`` is a required absolute-integer hyperparameter throughout
    :mod:`polars_features.detect`.  Pick it from the economics (the shortest
    episode you care to detect), freeze it, and never let it see ``len(y)``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    nobs : int
        Sample length ``T``.
    acknowledge_leak : bool, default=False
        Must be ``True``.  The flag exists so that the leak is impossible to
        introduce by accident.

    Returns
    -------
    int
        The PSY minimum window for this ``T``.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``acknowledge_leak`` is not ``True``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> psy_min_window(400, acknowledge_leak=True)
    40
    >>> psy_min_window(800, acknowledge_leak=True)
