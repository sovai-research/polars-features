"""Dependency-free fractional-differencing kernel and causal expression builder.

This is a **leaf module**: it imports ONLY :mod:`numpy` and :mod:`polars`. It is
the single source of truth for the fixed-width-window fractional-differencing
("FFD") weights and the causal frac-diff expression, shared by

* the estimator layer -- :mod:`polars_features.transform.frac_diff`
  (:class:`~polars_features.transform.frac_diff.FracDiff`), and
* the Polars-native namespace layer -- :mod:`polars_features.namespaces.panel`
  (``pl.col(...).panel.frac_diff`` and the frame-level ``.panel.frac_diff``),

as well as the compatibility shims ``.ts.frac_diff``
(:mod:`polars_features.feature_extractors`) and
:func:`polars_features.preprocessing.fractional_diff`.

Because this module depends on nothing inside the package it can be imported by
the ``namespaces`` layer without violating that layer's import boundary (which
forbids importing :mod:`polars_features.core` / :mod:`polars_features.transform`),
while still giving every surface exactly **one** weight recursion and **one**
causal expression builder. See de Prado, *Advances in Financial Machine
Learning* (Wiley, 2018), Chapter 5.

#: The value was raised from the historical ``1e-5`` to ``5e-4`` to fix a
#: silent all-null footgun: at ``1e-5`` the kernel for a typical ``d`` is very
#: long (e.g. ``d=0.4`` -> width 1458), so on a 500-1000 row per-entity series
#: the leading-null warm-up covered *every* row and ``frac_diff`` returned 0
#: non-null values while still paying the full compute cost. At ``5e-4`` the
#: kernel is a few dozen to ~a hundred terms for common ``d`` (``d=0.4`` ->
#: width 90, ``d=0.5`` -> 69, ``d=0.9`` -> 17), so a default call on a 500-1000
#: row series returns *mostly* non-null values while still retaining meaningful
#: long memory. Callers that want a longer kernel pass a smaller ``threshold``
#: (or an explicit ``max_width``) exactly as before -- only the default moved.
DEFAULT_THRESHOLD: float = 5e-4

#: Hard safety cap on the kernel width used when ``max_width`` is ``None``, to
#: avoid pathological non-termination for tiny thresholds / near-integer ``d``.

        w_0 = 1

    Generation stops once ``|w_k| < threshold`` or ``max_width`` weights have
    been produced (when ``max_width`` is ``None`` a large :data:`SAFETY_MAX_WIDTH`

    for a trailing weighted window.

    Parameters
    ----------
    d : float
        Differencing order. ``0`` is the identity, ``1`` is the first
        difference; non-integer values give fractional differencing.
    threshold : float, default=:data:`DEFAULT_THRESHOLD`

        width). Must be positive.
    max_width : int, optional
        Hard cap on the window width, regardless of ``threshold``.

    Returns

    numpy.ndarray
        1-D array of weights, oldest-to-newest.

    Computes the causal weighted trailing dot-product
    ``w[-1]*x[t] + w[-2]*x[t-1] + ... + w[0]*x[t-(width-1)]`` for every row that
    has a full trailing window, and emits ``null`` for the incomplete leading
    warm-up. The expression is **entity-agnostic**: grouping is the caller's
    responsibility via ``.over(entity)``.

    Provide either ``d`` (weights are built via :func:`ffd_weights`) or a
    precomputed ``weights`` array (oldest-to-newest, as returned by
    :func:`ffd_weights`).

    Implementation
    --------------
    The filter is applied as a **causal FIR convolution** of each series with
    the (reversed, newest-first) weight kernel via
    ``numpy.convolve(values, weights[::-1])[:n]``, executed inside a Polars
    ``map_batches`` UDF. Under ``.over(entity)`` Polars calls the UDF once per
    entity group with that group's values, so the convolution never crosses an
    entity boundary and stays strictly causal (row ``t`` uses only ``x[t]`` and
    earlier). This replaces the previous ``pl.sum_horizontal`` of ``width``
    lagged ``.shift()`` terms, which built an ``O(n * width)`` expression tree
    (thousands of shift nodes for a long kernel) and was ~65-144x slower.

    Warm-up / null policy
    ---------------------
    The first ``min(width - 1, n - 1)`` rows of each group are emitted as
    ``null`` (an incomplete trailing window). When the kernel fits inside the
    series (``width - 1 < n`` -- the normal case and every case where the old
    ``sum_horizontal`` path produced a valid non-null value) this is exactly
    ``width - 1`` leading nulls and the non-null values are bit-for-bit the same
    dot products as before. When the kernel is *longer* than the series
    (``width - 1 >= n``) the old path nulled **every** row; this path instead
    caps the warm-up at ``n - 1`` so at least the final, fullest-window row is a
    correctly-computed partial output rather than returning all-null.

    Interior ``null`` inputs are treated as ``0`` inside the convolution,
    matching the historical ``sum_horizontal`` zero-fill behaviour.
