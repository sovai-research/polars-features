"""Evolutionary alpha-factor mining for panel data.

``polars_features.evolve`` searches a space of *formulaic* features -- Polars
expressions built from a typed, leak-safe operator grammar -- and returns a
decorrelated pool with an honest statistic attached to it.

What makes this different from the rest of the field
----------------------------------------------------
A survey of ~40 symbolic-regression / genetic-programming libraries and 9
open-source alpha miners found that **none** of them are panel-aware and
**none** implement purging, embargo, or any multiple-testing control. Two
consequences follow, and this package is built around both:

* **Leak-safety is structural, not advisory.** The grammar admits an operator
  only if its :class:`~polars_features.registry.FeatureSpec` is
  ``leakage_safe``; ``.over(entity)`` / ``.over(time)`` are applied by the
  compiler, never hand-written into an operator body. A look-ahead feature is
  not penalised, it is *unconstructible*. :func:`assert_causal` provides an
  independent empirical check via prefix invariance.

* **Every candidate is counted.** Searching 100,000 expressions against a
  return target is the purest multiple-testing machine ever built: under the
  null, the expected best in-sample Sharpe is about 4.4. :class:`TrialLedger`
  records every evaluation, estimates the *implied independent* trial count
  (Bailey & Lopez de Prado, Deflated Sharpe Ratio, Appendix 3 -- most
  candidates are highly correlated, so the raw count is the wrong N), and
  deflates accordingly.

A caution about expectations
----------------------------
The independent AlphaEval benchmark (KDD 2026) re-evaluated the published
alpha miners under one protocol and found the entire field scoring 0.017-0.041
predictive power against a **random-formula baseline of 0.009**, with every
method *less diverse* than random formulas. Treat a high in-sample score as a
hypothesis, read :meth:`EvolveResult.summary` before believing it, and prefer
:func:`minimum_backtest_length` to decide the budget *before* spending it.

Examples
--------
>>> import polars_features as pk  # doctest: +SKIP
>>> res = pk.evolve.evolve_features(  # doctest: +SKIP
...     panel, target="fwd_ret_5d", entity="ticker", time="date"
... )
>>> print(res.summary())  # doctest: +SKIP
>>> res.to_frame()  # doctest: +SKIP
