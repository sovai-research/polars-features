"""Honest reporting for mined alphas: trial accounting, deflation, causality.

This module exists because of a single, reproducible failure mode:
**search-count amnesia**. A genetic / symbolic search evaluates :math:`M`
candidates, keeps the best one, and reports its in-sample score as if it had
been the only thing ever tried. Every surveyed alpha-mining repository does
this. AlphaGen is the clearest case: it maintains ``pool.eval_cnt``, increments
it on every evaluation, and the *only* consumer of that counter is a
TensorBoard logging call. The trial count is measured and then thrown away. Not
one paper in the surveyed literature reports :math:`N`. Without :math:`N` you
cannot deflate anything.

The stakes, measured with PanelKit's own
:func:`~polars_features.validation.expected_maximum_sharpe`: a 100,000-trial
search on **pure noise** is expected to produce a best in-sample Sharpe of
**4.39**; at :math:`N = 10` it is already **1.57**. A raw best-of-search score is
therefore not a weak statistic, it is a fabrication.

What is here
------------
* :class:`TrialLedger` — records every evaluated candidate and computes
  :math:`M`, :math:`V[\\{SR_n\\}]`, :math:`\\bar\\rho` and the *implied number of
  independent trials* :math:`\\hat N`, then feeds those into PanelKit's existing
  :func:`~polars_features.core.model_selection.deflated_sharpe_ratio` and
  :func:`~polars_features.core.model_selection.probability_of_backtest_overfitting`.
* :func:`minimum_backtest_length` — the pre-flight budget constraint: how much
  history you need before :math:`N` trials stop guaranteeing a false positive.
* :func:`assert_causal` — prefix invariance made executable; the look-ahead
  detector.
* :func:`haircut_sharpe_ratio` — Harvey & Liu's multiple-testing haircut.
* :func:`cross_sectional_bootstrap` — the Yan-Zheng joint-date bootstrap, the
  one test a mechanically-mined signal can legitimately *pass*.
* :func:`search_diagnostics` — the in-sample vs held-out scatter over **all**
  candidates, which tells you whether the search found anything at all.

Honest about the limits of this honesty tooling
-----------------------------------------------
The Deflated Sharpe Ratio is reported here as **a conservative screen with
unquantified type-I error control, not a p-value**. Steven Pav (author of R's
``SharpeR``) makes the case in *"Pseudo-Statistics and Quantitative
Charlatanism"* (https://sharperat.io/do-not-deflate-I.html, 2026-07-11): the DSR
paper states no null hypothesis and offers no proof that the statistic is
uniform under one, and the maximum of :math:`N` i.i.d. Gaussians is Gumbel, not
Gaussian, so treating :math:`\\Phi` of a centred maximum as a probability is an
approximation of unknown quality. His :math:`10^6`-replication simulations find
DSR is **conservative rather than anti-conservative** — a nominal 0.10 test
rejects at 0.042 unconditionally, and roughly 1 in 3,361 conditionally.

Practically: a low DSR is strong evidence *against* a candidate; a high DSR is
weak evidence *for* one, and is certainly not "the probability the strategy is
real". The PBO gate is the sharper instrument, and Bailey, Borwein, Lopez de
Prado & Zhu state the rule plainly — *"reject models for which PBO is estimated
to be greater than 0.05"* — which is what :meth:`TrialLedger.summary` enforces.

class TrialLedger:
    """Record every candidate a search evaluates, so it can be deflated.

    The ledger is the antidote to search-count amnesia. Give it one
    :meth:`record` call per *evaluated* candidate — not per survivor, not per
    generation, per **evaluation** — and it maintains everything the deflation
    machinery needs:

    ``M``
        the exact number of trials.
    ``V[{SR_n}]``
        the variance of the scores *across trials*. This is the term everyone
        omits and the one the Deflated Sharpe Ratio actually needs: the DSR
        deflates against ``sqrt(V) * f(N)``, so with ``V`` missing the whole
        correction is missing.
    ``rho_bar``
        the average pairwise correlation between candidate return streams.
    ``N_hat``
        the *implied number of independent trials*, see
        :meth:`implied_independent_trials`.

    Memory discipline
    -----------------
    Storing full per-period series for :math:`10^5` candidates is not
    affordable. The ledger therefore keeps:

    * **exact** running moments (Welford) and exact scalars — score, held-out
      score, complexity, generation — for *every* trial, ~32 bytes each;
    * a **seeded reservoir sample** (Algorithm R, default 2000 candidates) of
      the full per-period series, used for the correlation matrix, PBO and the
      PCA cross-check;
    * the best candidate's series unconditionally, so the headline statistic is
      never an approximation.

    So ``M``, ``V`` and the best score are exact; ``rho_bar``, ``N_hat`` and
    ``PBO`` are estimated from a uniform random sample of the search. With the
    default reservoir the standard error of ``rho_bar`` is negligible relative
    to the order-of-magnitude precision ``N_hat`` is used at.

    Parameters
    ----------
    reservoir_size : int, default=2000
        Number of per-period series retained for correlation/PBO work.
    seed : int, default=0
        Seed for the reservoir sampler. Determinism is a hard invariant.
    series_kind : {"returns", "cumulative"}, default="returns"
        Whether :meth:`record` is given per-period values (returns, per-period
        ICs) or a cumulative PnL curve. Correlations are **always** computed on
        first differences: correlating cumulative curves manufactures
        correlation out of the common trend, which would collapse ``N_hat``
        toward 1 and make the deflation vanish. This is WorldQuant's stated
        convention and it is not optional.

    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng(0)
    >>> ledger = TrialLedger(seed=0)

        the maximum of 50,000 independent draws that were never taken) and
        passing ``n_trials = 1`` is simply a lie. Eq. 9 gives ~5,001, which is
        the defensible number. No Python package implements this.

        Returns
        -------
        float
            ``N_hat``, clipped to ``[1, M]``. Falls back to the conservative
            ``float(M)`` when no per-period series were recorded, since without
            series there is no evidence that the trials were redundant.

        Eq. 9 is a single-number summary of the whole correlation matrix and it

        population has structure — a handful of tight clusters plus a long tail
        of one-offs — the eigenvalue spectrum says more. Two standard effective
        dimensions of the reservoir correlation matrix, each rescaled by

    Everything that leaks violates this — an explicit ``shift(-1)``, but also a
    global mean, a full-sample z-score, a threshold estimated on all the data,
    a window whose size depends on ``len(x)``. The test does not care *how* the
    leak happened, only that the value at time ``t`` moved when data after
    ``t`` appeared.

    The frame is sorted by ``(time, entity)`` so that every time-prefix is a
    literal row-prefix; the expression is evaluated on the whole frame and on
    each truncated frame, and the overlapping rows are compared null-aware.
    Nulls are compared as nulls, which is what catches ``shift(-1)``: at the
    prefix boundary the truncated frame has a null where the full frame has a
    value.

    Parameters
    ----------
    expr : polars.Expr
        The expression to check, **including** its ``.over(...)``. The
        ``evolve`` compiler owns grouping, so this is the object it emits.

    """Multiple-testing haircut of a Sharpe ratio (Harvey & Liu, 2015).

    Harvey & Liu, *"Backtesting"*, JPM 42(1):13-28. Their warning, which is the
    reason this cannot be replaced by a rule of thumb:

        *"the multiple testing haircut is nonlinear... it is a serious mistake
        to use the rule of thumb 50% haircut."*

    The haircut is small for genuinely exceptional Sharpes and brutal for
    marginal ones; a flat percentage gets both ends wrong.

    Method (implemented from the published equations; the authors' reference
    code is MATLAB-only and the sole faithful port is GPL-3, so this is a
    clean-room implementation)

    1. Convert the observed Sharpe to a t-statistic ``t = SR * sqrt(T)`` and a
       two-sided p-value.
    2. Draw the t-statistics of the *other* ``n_trials`` tests from the
       Harvey-Liu-Zhu structural model, calibrated to the published table: a
       fraction ``p0`` of tests are truly null, the rest have true mean returns
       drawn from an exponential with mean ``lambda``, and all tests share an
       equicorrelation ``rho`` through a single common factor,
       ``t_j = nu_j + sqrt(rho) w + sqrt(1-rho) u_j``. At ``rho = 0.2`` the
       table gives ``M = 1377``, ``p0 = 0.44589``, ``lambda = 0.0055508``
       monthly, i.e. a non-centrality of ``lambda*sqrt(240)/(0.15/sqrt(12))``
       ~ 1.99.
    3. Insert the observed p-value into that family and apply Bonferroni, Holm
       and Benjamini-Yekutieli (BHY) — reusing PanelKit's
       :func:`~polars_features.validation.holm_bonferroni` and
       :func:`~polars_features.validation.benjamini_yekutieli`.
    4. Take the **median** adjusted p-value over ``n_sim`` draws, invert it to a
       t-statistic and back to a Sharpe.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sharpe : float
        Observed **per-observation** Sharpe, matching ``n_observations``. Must
        be positive (a negative Sharpe needs no haircut).
    n_trials : int
        Size of the multiple-testing family — your own search count, for which
        :meth:`TrialLedger.implied_independent_trials` is the defensible input.
        Passing the ``hlz_total_tests`` value returned in the result reproduces
        the paper's published, literature-wide haircuts.
    n_observations : int, default=240
        Sample length ``T`` used for ``t = SR * sqrt(T)``. The default is HLZ's
        own calibration sample, 20 years of monthly returns.
    rho : float, default=0.2
        Assumed average correlation between test statistics. Clipped to the
        published range ``[0, 0.8]`` and linearly interpolated within it.
    n_sim : int, default=2000
        Number of simulated families. Cost is ``O(n_sim * n_trials)``.
    seed : int, default=0
        RNG seed.

    Returns
    -------
    dict of str to float
        ``sharpe``, ``t_stat``, ``p_value``, ``n_trials``, ``n_observations``,
        ``rho``, ``p0``, ``lambda``, ``hlz_total_tests``, and for each of
        ``bonferroni`` / ``holm`` / ``bhy`` / ``average`` the median adjusted
        p-value (``*_pvalue``), the haircut Sharpe (``*_sharpe``) and the
        proportional haircut (``*_haircut``, in ``[0, 1]``).

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``sharpe <= 0``, ``n_trials < 1``, ``n_observations < 2`` or
        ``n_sim < 1``.

    Yan & Zheng, *RFS* 30(4):1382-1423, mined 18,000 fundamental signals and
    then did the thing the rest of the literature does not: they built the null
    distribution *of the mining process itself*. The construction is what makes
    it work:

    * every candidate's series is **demeaned**, imposing ``alpha = 0`` exactly;
    * dates are resampled **jointly across all candidates** — one index vector
      per replication, applied to every column — so the cross-sectional
      correlation between candidates, which is what makes a large maximum easy
      to obtain by chance, is preserved;
    * the statistic compared is an **extreme percentile** of the candidate
      t-statistics, not an average.

    This is the one test under which a mechanically-mined signal can
    legitimately *pass*: Yan & Zheng found a 99th-percentile t-statistic of 4.82

    quantiles : sequence of float, default=(0.90, 0.95, 0.99, 1.00)
        Cross-sectional quantiles of the t-statistics to test. ``1.00`` is the
        maximum.
    block_length : int, default=1
        Mean block length of a stationary bootstrap over dates. ``1`` is the
        i.i.d. date resampling of the original paper; raise it if the series
        are serially dependent.
