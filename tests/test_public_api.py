"""The top-level public surface must stay complete.

`panelary.detect` shipped in 0.4.0 with 37 public symbols and a large
test suite, and was unreachable as ``pn.detect`` because nothing added it to
``panelary/__init__.py``. Three separate audits found it independently,
which is the signature of a gap that review does not catch. These tests make it
a build failure instead.

The rule enforced here: every public subpackage is reachable as an attribute of
``panelary``, and is either exported in ``__all__`` (light modules) or
declared in ``_LAZY_SUBMODULES`` (modules whose eager import would break the
light-core guarantee).
