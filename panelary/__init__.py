"""Panelary: leak-safe, fast feature engineering and ML for panel data, built on Polars.

Panelary turns a long-format ``(entity, time, *features)`` panel into a first-class,
lazy, leak-safe object. It provides the :class:`PanelFrame` view, a leak-safe
sklearn-shaped :class:`Pipeline`, the ``.panel`` / ``.xs`` Polars expression and
frame namespaces, finance-grade cross-validation (:class:`PurgedKFold`,
:class:`CombinatorialPurgedCV`) and backtest-overfitting metrics
(:func:`deflated_sharpe_ratio`, :func:`probability_of_backtest_overfitting`).

Panelary is built on the foundations of `functime <https://github.com/functime-org/functime>`_
(Apache-2.0, actively maintained) and interoperates with functime and Nixtla rather
than replacing them. The project is Panelary, the distribution is ``panelary``,
and the import convention is ``import panelary as pn``.

Public symbols are imported lazily and guarded: an optional component that fails to
import emits a warning but never breaks the rest of the package. Whatever is actually
available is listed in :data:`__all__`.

# mrmr` and `import panelary.select as s` all work. The other five verbs shadow
