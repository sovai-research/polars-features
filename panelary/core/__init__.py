"""Panelary core: the correctness-by-construction panel ML kernel.

This subpackage is the *moat* of Panelary. It provides a small, stable, fully
typed, lazy-first (pure Polars) foundation that every higher-level component
(concrete transformers, the feature registry, models) builds on:

* :class:`~panelary.core.panel_frame.PanelFrame` — a typed, lazy view over
  a long-format ``(entity, time, *features)`` panel that validates the keys once
  and stays lazy.
* :class:`~panelary.core.protocol.PanelTransformer` /
  :class:`~panelary.core.protocol.PanelEstimator` — sklearn-shaped base
  classes carrying an explicit, machine-checkable leakage contract
  (``panel_safe`` / ``leakage_safe``).
* :class:`~panelary.core.pipeline.Pipeline` — a leak-safe chain of steps
  with sklearn ergonomics.
* :mod:`~panelary.core.model_selection` — finance-grade, leak-safe
  cross-validation (:class:`PurgedKFold`, :class:`CombinatorialPurgedCV`,
  walk-forward splitters) and de Prado overfitting metrics
  (:func:`deflated_sharpe_ratio`, :func:`probability_of_backtest_overfitting`).

All public names are re-exported here and (additively) from the top-level
``panelary`` package.
