"""The evolutionary search loop: islands, selection, archive, and the ledger.

This module wires the pieces together. Its job is less "run a genetic
algorithm" -- that part is a few hundred lines and thoroughly commoditised --
than to make sure every candidate the search touches is *counted*, and that the
thing handed back to the user is a decorrelated pool with an honest error bar
attached.

Shape of the loop
-----------------
Per generation, per island:

1. Compile the whole island population into **one** layered Polars plan
   (:func:`._compile.compile_population`). Shared subexpressions collapse to a
   single node; measured 10.9x on this repo.
2. Score under purged/embargoed CV (:class:`._fitness.PanelEvaluator`), which
   also emits a per-case matrix.
3. Record **every** candidate in the :class:`._honest.TrialLedger` -- before
   any filtering. This is the step the published literature skips.
4. Select parents by semi-dynamic epsilon-lexicase on the case matrix.
5. Vary, deduplicate (structurally *and* semantically), and refill.
6. Offer every candidate to the MAP-Elites archive.

Islands migrate on a ring every ``migration_every`` generations and may be
reset (worst half reseeded from a survivor's elite) every ``reset_every``
generations -- FunSearch's anti-convergence mechanism, which is the closest
published analogue to the alpha-crowding problem.

Why the defaults are small
--------------------------
``population=200``/``generations=20`` is 4,000 evaluations, not the 10^5-10^6
the older literature used. Two reasons. Statistically, more trials is not free:
the expected best in-sample Sharpe under the null grows as roughly
``sqrt(2 ln N)``, so a 100,000-trial search on pure noise is *expected* to hand
you a Sharpe near 4.4 (verified against Panelary's own
``expected_maximum_sharpe``). Empirically, the field has moved the same way --
LLM-FE reached state of the art on 37 datasets with **20** samples, and
AlphaBench measured evolutionary capacity saturating at 20 candidates per
round. Budget is a parameter, not a virtue; :func:`._honest.minimum_backtest_length`
will tell you what your panel can actually afford before you spend it.

Honesty is not optional here
----------------------------
:meth:`EvolveResult.summary` always reports the deflated statistic alongside
the raw one, and :attr:`EvolveResult.diagnostics` always carries the
in-sample-vs-held-out scatter across *all* candidates. If that cloud is round,
the search found nothing, and the report says so in words.

    Parameters
    ----------
    population : int
        Individuals per island, per generation.
    generations : int
        Number of generations.
    n_islands : int
        Independent subpopulations. FunSearch used 10; LLM-FE used 3 for
        feature engineering. Small is fine and cheaper to deflate.
    min_genes, n_genes, max_depth : int
        Genome size range (ramped between the two) and the hard cap on DAG
        depth. ``max_depth`` is low on
        purpose: Polars planning time is quadratic in expression depth, and
        complex strategies decay worse out of sample.
    downsample : float
        Fraction of cases each epsilon-lexicase selection event sees.
    migration_every, reset_every : int or None
        Ring migration and island-reset cadences, in generations.
    noise_features : int
        Number of shuffled/Gaussian decoys injected as an in-run null. A
        candidate must beat the best *decoy*, not merely beat zero.
    max_library : int
        Cap on the returned decorrelated pool.
    holdout_frac : float
        Fraction of the *latest* dates withheld from the search entirely and
        used only to score the finished pool. Set to 0.0 to disable, but note
        that the search diagnostic is meaningless without it: correlating two
        halves of the same cross-validated score measures consistency, not
        generalisation, and will report "signal" on pure noise.
    seed : int
        Explicit seed; the whole search is reproducible from it.

    a look-ahead feature is not merely penalised -- it is unconstructible. Every
    candidate is scored under purged, embargoed cross-validation, every
    evaluation is counted, and the result carries a deflated statistic.

    Parameters
    ----------
    panel : PanelFrame or polars.DataFrame or polars.LazyFrame
        Long-format panel. If a bare frame is passed, ``entity`` and ``time``
        are required.
    target : str
        Column holding the forward-looking label. Build it with
        :func:`panelary.factor.forward_return` so the horizon is
        explicit -- the embargo is derived from it.
    base_columns : sequence of str, optional
        Terminals the grammar may use. Defaults to every numeric column that
        is not the target or a key.
    base_units : sequence of str, optional
        Semantic unit per base column. Inferred from column names if omitted.
    entity, time : str, optional
        Panel keys, when ``panel`` is not a :class:`~panelary.PanelFrame`.
    config : EvolveConfig, optional
        Search budget and operators.

    Returns
    -------
    EvolveResult
        The selected pool, the quality-diversity archive, the trial ledger's
        summary, and the search diagnostics.

    Notes
    -----
    Before spending a large budget, check what the panel can support:
    :func:`panelary.evolve.minimum_backtest_length` implements Bailey,
    Borwein, Lopez de Prado & Zhu's bound. Their example is sobering -- with
    five years of daily data, no more than ~45 *independent* configurations
    should be tried before a Sharpe of 1 becomes essentially guaranteed under
    the null.
