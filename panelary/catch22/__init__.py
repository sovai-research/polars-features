"""Clean-room, Polars-native implementation of the *catch22* feature set.

catch22 (Lubba et al., 2019, "catch22: CAnonical Time-series CHaracteristics",
*Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery* 33, 1821-1852) is a curated collection of
22 time-series features selected from the ~7700 features of the *hctsa* library
for high classification performance and low mutual redundancy.

This module is a **clean-room re-implementation** written directly from the
published algorithmic descriptions -- it does **not** vendor or copy any code
from the GPL-licensed ``pycatch22`` / ``hctsa`` sources.  Each of the 22
canonical features is implemented as a small, documented Python function that
operates on a 1-D :class:`numpy.ndarray`.

Following the standard "catch22" variant, every feature *z-scores* the input
series (mean 0, standard deviation 1, using the sample standard deviation with
``ddof=1``) before computing.  Z-scoring is idempotent, so the feature functions
are safe to call directly on raw data.

Two convenience entry points are provided:

* :func:`catch22_all` -- compute all 22 features (or 24 with ``catch24=True``,
  which appends the raw mean and standard deviation) for a single 1-D array,
  returning a ``dict[str, float]``.
* :func:`catch22_features` -- a Polars-friendly entry point that computes the
  features **per entity** on a (long-format) panel :class:`polars.DataFrame` /
  :class:`polars.LazyFrame`, returning one row per entity.  The per-entity
  ``group_by`` makes the computation leak-safe: every feature uses only the
  values of its own series.

Correctness notes
-----------------
A handful of the canonical features rely on fairly intricate sub-routines
(spline detrending, adaptive histogram binning, piecewise-linear fitting of
fluctuation scaling).  Those are implemented as faithful, documented
best-effort re-derivations and are flagged in their docstrings as
``NEEDS REVIEW`` for exact numerical parity with ``pycatch22``.  They are
algorithmically sound and return finite, correctly-signed values, but their
last-digit outputs may differ from the reference C implementation.
