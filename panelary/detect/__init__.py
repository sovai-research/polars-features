"""Causal detection of explosive regimes, bubbles and changepoints.

The fifth pillar of Panelary. Every statistic here is a function of data up to
``t`` and nothing after it: recomputing a feature at date ``t`` with more data
appended returns the **bitwise identical** value. That is asserted mechanically
in ``tests/test_detect_leak_safety.py``, not merely intended.

What's here
-----------
:mod:`~panelary.detect._moments` -- **the prefix-sum engine**
    :func:`cumulative_moments` accumulates the ADF regression's sufficient
    statistics once in ``O(T k^2)``; every window is then a difference of two
    cumulative sums, so any of the ``~T^2/2`` nested windows costs ``O(1)`` to
    assemble. The identity that removes the last ``O(n)`` term is ``SSR =
    s - beta'b`` (exact because ``A beta = b``), which no published
    implementation exploits -- the fastest reference kernel still forms
    residuals in full and is therefore ``O(T^3)``, not ``O(T^2)``.
    :func:`window_adf` evaluates the whole ``(end x start)`` surface with no
    Python loop; :func:`window_adf_qr` is the accurate fallback.

:mod:`~panelary.detect._bsadf` -- **recursive right-tailed unit root**
    :func:`bsadf_sequence` is the backward sup-ADF: at each endpoint, the
    supremum of the ADF t-statistic over all admissible start dates. Its
    window's right edge is pinned at ``t``, so every regression in the supremum
    terminates at ``t``. ``T=1000`` exhaustive (452,676 windows) in ~0.02 s of
    pure NumPy, against 0.78 s for the fastest published C++ implementation.

:mod:`~panelary.detect._critvals` -- **calibration without leakage**
    :func:`mc_table` exploits the fact that on a driftless random-walk null the
    BSADF sequence is *itself* point-in-time, so its value at index ``n`` **is**
    the length-``n`` statistic and paths nest exactly: one simulation yields
    ``cv[t]`` for every ``t`` at once. :func:`kurozumi_boundary` and
    :func:`training_max_cv` are analytic and training-sample alternatives that
    simulate nothing at all.

:mod:`~panelary.detect._monitors` -- **O(1) sequential detectors**
    :func:`page_cusum` in closed form (Lindley's recursion solves to a
    reflection, ``S - min(cummin(S), 0)``, so it is two cumulative aggregations
    and a subtraction -- see :func:`page_cusum_expr` for the Polars form);
    :func:`shiryaev_roberts` in log space; :func:`focus`, which is provably
    equivalent to running Page's CUSUM at *every* magnitude and *every* window
    length simultaneously with no tuning parameter, at ``O(log n)`` amortised;
    :func:`hb_cusum` with an analytic boundary; :func:`end_of_sample_S`.

:mod:`~panelary.detect._panel` -- **cross-sectional aggregation**
    :func:`breadth` -- the fraction of the cross-section exceeding its
    threshold -- rather than the conventional cross-sectional mean, which is
    hostage to a few extreme names because the statistic diverges
    exponentially under the alternative. :func:`residualise` projects out
    backward-looking factors with betas frozen at ``t``; without it the panel
    null is intractable (see below).

Leak-safety
-----------
Three rules govern the whole package, each with a measured consequence:

**No quantity may depend on the length of the data you happen to hold.** The
conventional minimum-window rule ``floor(T(0.01 + 1.8/sqrt(T)))`` revises 46% of
already-published dates by more than 0.05 when ``T`` grows from 800 to 1600
(mean ``|delta|`` 0.160, max 1.576). ``min_window`` is therefore a required
absolute-integer hyperparameter with no default derived from the sample.

**Simulated critical values are safe; bootstrapped ones are not.** The Monte
Carlo null is ``cumsum(randn(n))`` -- it contains no data and depends only on
``(n, min_window, lag)``. The wild bootstrap fits its null model on the whole
sample: a critical value from full-sample residuals measured 1.150 where the
value available in real time at ``t=200`` was 0.914.

**Anchor, do not centre.** Prefix sums are invariant to a level shift only if
the anchor is; ``y - y[0]`` is both accurate and constant as data arrives, while
the sample mean moves. Accumulators block-reset every ``block`` rows, which caps
error at ~1e-12 for any series length.

Deliberately refused
--------------------
Full-sample ``GSADF`` as a per-row feature (it is a supremum over the entire
sample by construction; the point-in-time analogue is ``cummax(bsadf)``), and
episode peak / end / duration, which are knowable only once an episode has
ended. :func:`gsadf` returns a scalar for a whole series and
:func:`psy_min_window` requires ``acknowledge_leak=True``.

What this can and cannot do
---------------------------
Detection delay, conditional on detection, is short: median 3-16 observations,
5-13% of a bubble's own duration. **Unconditional power is the binding
constraint** -- a 10-period bubble at ``delta=1.03`` is detected with
probability ~0.2, so short mild episodes are missed entirely.

Cross-sectional pooling is the one real escape, and it is contingent on
:func:`residualise`. With equicorrelated shocks and no bubble anywhere, the 95th
percentile of sup-over-``t`` breadth runs 0.030 at ``rho=0``, 0.347 at
``rho=0.6`` and **0.830 at ``rho=0.9``** -- the effective sample size is roughly
``1/rho``, not ``N``. Project out the common factor first.
