# Migrating to Panelary

As of **0.5.0** the project is called **Panelary**. The import path and the PyPI
distribution are both `panelary`.

| | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Install | `pip install polars-features` | `pip install panelary` |
| Import | `import polars_features` | `import panelary as pn` |
| Extras | `polars-features[recommended]` | `panelary[recommended]` |
| Attribution hook | `panelkit_shap_values` | `panelary_shap_values` |
| Env overrides | `PANELKIT_*` | `PANELARY_*` |

**There is no compatibility shim.** `import polars_features` will simply stop
working, and that is deliberate — see [Why no shim?](#why-no-shim) below.

Which section applies to you depends on where you are coming from.

## Read this first: what actually shipped where

Only the **0.1 line** was ever published to PyPI, and only under the old name:
`polars-features` 0.1.0, 0.1.5, 0.1.6 and 0.1.7. That release line was a
*maintained fork of functime* — modern packaging, current Polars, green CI — and
nothing more.

Versions **0.2.0, 0.3.0 and 0.4.0 were never published to PyPI under any name.**
Everything people think of as Panelary — `PanelFrame`, the leak-safe `Pipeline`,
CPCV, `detect`, `explain`, `validation`, `econ`, `reduce`, `cluster`, `select`,
`factor` — was built after 0.1.7 and reached the public for the first time as
`panelary` 0.5.0.

So there are exactly two migration stories.

---

## If you are on `polars-features` 0.1.7 (PyPI)

**This is not a drop-in swap.** Do not expect `pip install panelary` plus a
find-and-replace to leave your code working. 0.1.7's API surface was functime's;
0.5.0's is a panel-first library that happens to share that engine underneath.
Budget real time for this, and treat it as adopting a new library that you happen
to already trust.

What you should expect to deal with:

1. **The version number goes backwards in spirit and forwards in fact.** You are
   moving from `polars-features==0.1.7` to `panelary>=0.5.0`. If you pin in a
   requirements file, **rewrite the constraint by hand** — a blind
   `s/polars-features/panelary/` turns `polars-features>=0.1.7` into
   `panelary>=0.1.7`, which resolves to nothing useful and will silently pick up
   whatever the resolver likes.
2. **Dependencies got slim (0.4.0).** The hard dependency set is now exactly
   `numpy` and `polars`. `scikit-learn`, `scipy`, `flaml`, `holidays` and `tqdm`
   moved to extras. To get back the batteries-included behaviour you had on
   0.1.7:

   ```bash
   pip install 'panelary[recommended]'   # ml + scipy + seasonality + cafe
   pip install 'panelary[all]'           # everything optional
   ```

   Without an extra, code paths that need those libraries raise a single
   actionable `pip install 'panelary[<extra>]'` message at first use rather than
   at import.
3. **The Rust extension is gone (0.4.0).** Panelary ships one universal
   `py3-none-any` wheel. No compiler, no per-platform wheels. If you were pinning
   platform wheels or building from source with maturin, delete that machinery.
   The one kernel worth keeping — CUSUM — is pure Python with an optional
   `numba` fast path via `pip install 'panelary[fast]'`.
4. **New APIs, and the old ones still there.** The functime-derived engine
   (feature extractors, forecasting, preprocessing, seasonality, cross-validation,
   metrics, LLM analysis) is still present and importable from `panelary`. Your
   0.1.7 call sites are most likely to survive the move. What is *new* is
   everything layered on top, and the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) entries for
   0.2.0 through 0.5.0 are the honest inventory of it.

The pragmatic path: change the install and the import, run your test suite, and
fix what breaks. Then read the changelog to find out what you now have.

---

## If you are tracking a git ref (0.2.x – 0.4.0)

This one *is* close to mechanical. The rename was the only breaking change; the
API is otherwise unchanged from the commit before it.

Four things changed that a rename tool needs to know about:

- `polars_features` → `panelary` (module path)
- `polars-features` → `panelary` (distribution name)
- `panelkit_shap_values` → `panelary_shap_values` (the public attribution hook)
- `PANELKIT_*` → `PANELARY_*` (test-guard env overrides:
  `PANELARY_IMPORT_BUDGET_MS`, `PANELARY_WHEEL_BUDGET_MB`,
  `PANELARY_DETECT_STRICT`)

### The one-liner

Run this from the root of *your* project (not this repo). It works on both GNU
and BSD/macOS `sed`, and leaves `.bak` files behind so you can back out.

```bash
grep -rl --include='*.py' --include='*.pyi' --include='*.ipynb' --include='*.md' \
     -e polars_features -e panelkit_shap_values -e PANELKIT_ . \
| xargs sed -i.bak \
    -e 's/polars_features/panelary/g' \
    -e 's/panelkit_shap_values/panelary_shap_values/g' \
    -e 's/PANELKIT_/PANELARY_/g'
```

Then check, and clean up:

```bash
grep -rn 'polars_features\|polars-features\|panelkit\|PANELKIT_' . --exclude='*.bak'
find . -name '*.bak' -delete
```

### Do the packaging files by hand

Deliberately **not** in the one-liner: `pyproject.toml`, `requirements*.txt`,
`setup.cfg`, `environment.yml`, lock files, Dockerfiles, CI workflows. A blind
substitution there produces broken version constraints (see point 1 above) and
mangles lock-file hashes. Edit the dependency name and the version constraint
together:

```diff
- polars-features>=0.4.0
+ panelary>=0.5.0
```

Then regenerate your lock file rather than editing it.

### If you implemented the attribution hook

If you wrote a custom model that exposes exact attributions to
`explain.TreeAttributor`, the method it looks for is now
`panelary_shap_values`. Rename it. Nothing warns you if you do not — the
attributor will simply fall back as though your model had no native path, and
you will get slower, approximate results with no error.

---

## Why no shim?

A forwarding `polars_features` package that re-exported `panelary` would be cheap
to write, and it would be a lie.

The only thing ever installed from PyPI as `polars_features` was the 0.1.x
functime fork. A shim published today would forward that name to an API which
never existed under it, so `import polars_features` would start returning
something wholly unlike what the last person to type it received. Anyone whose
code happened to keep working would be relying on a compatibility promise nobody
ever made, and anyone whose code broke would get a confusing failure inside a
package they did not install.

A hard `ModuleNotFoundError` is the honest outcome. It tells you exactly what
happened, it happens at import rather than three call frames deep, and it takes
one line to fix.

`polars-features` 0.1.7 stays on PyPI, installable forever, for anyone who
genuinely wants the old fork.

## Checklist

- [ ] `pip uninstall polars-features && pip install 'panelary[recommended]'`
- [ ] Run the one-liner over your sources (git-ref users), or change the imports
      by hand (0.1.7 users)
- [ ] Update `pyproject.toml` / `requirements*.txt` by hand — name **and**
      constraint
- [ ] Regenerate lock files
- [ ] Rename `panelkit_shap_values` → `panelary_shap_values` if you implemented it
- [ ] Rename any `PANELKIT_*` environment variables in CI
- [ ] Grep for stragglers: `grep -rn 'polars_features\|polars-features\|panelkit'`
- [ ] Run your tests

## Where to look next

- [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) — what landed in each version, including a marker
  at the point where the names change
- `README.md` — the current quickstart
- The documentation site — the canonical alias is `import panelary as pn`
