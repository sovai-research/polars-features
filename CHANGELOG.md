# Changelog

All notable changes to Panelary are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
While the major version is `0`, breaking changes land in a minor bump
(`0.4` → `0.5`).

Panelary is built on the foundations of [functime](https://github.com/functime-org/functime)
(Apache-2.0), which is actively maintained (v1.0.0, May 2026). Panelary reuses and credits
functime's feature-extraction and forecasting engine and adds a panel-first, leak-safe layer
on top — it interoperates with functime and Nixtla rather than replacing them.

**On names:** the project was published to PyPI as `polars-features` and imported as
`polars_features` through 0.1.7. Version 0.5.0 renames both to `panelary`. Entries for
0.4.0 and earlier keep the names that were true when they were written — see the note
above the 0.4.0 entry, and [MIGRATING.md](MIGRATING.md) for how to move.

## [Unreleased]

### Added — `leakage`: a point-in-time compiler, and a price for what leaks

Two tools, one package. `causalize` **prevents** leakage; `borrowed_accuracy`
**measures** it. They ship together because the metric is the compiler's test
suite: a rewrite that is genuinely point-in-time scores zero borrowed accuracy,
and one that does not score zero was not a rewrite. The subpackage is
`panelary.leakage` rather than `panelary.causal` because that verb is already
taken by the causal-inference pillar. Pure NumPy + Polars, eagerly imported —
it pulls in no optional dependency.

- **`audit` / `causalize`** — the compiler. It serialises a Polars expression to
  its tree (`Expr.meta.serialize(format="json")`), classifies every node against
  a rule table keyed by qualified node kind, rewrites the forward-reaching ones
  into expanding-window equivalents, and reads the mutated JSON back with
  `pl.Expr.deserialize`. A backward fill becomes a forward fill; a centred
  rolling window becomes trailing; a whole-column aggregate becomes a cumulative
  one. `audit` returns a `CompileResult` of `Finding`s and changes nothing;
  `causalize` returns the repaired expression or raises `LeakageRefused` with
  that same result attached. Both take the panel keys as `time=` / `entity=`;
  rewrites are applied bottom-up, and the walker recurses only into the payload
  keys a matching `Rule` declares as children, so an options dict can never be
  mistaken for a node.
- **`borrowed_accuracy`** — the metric. Run a pipeline twice: permissively, with
  every `Component` fit once on everything, and point-in-time, with each one
  refit per fold on training rows only. The gap is the accuracy *borrowed* from
  data the method will not have at prediction time. Ablating one component at a
  time cannot attribute it — two components can be individually harmless and
  leak badly together — so the attribution is the exact Shapley value of the
  game `v(S) = score when exactly S runs permissively`, computed over every one
  of the `2^k` subsets. Nothing is sampled, so `sum(attribution) == total`
  (Shapley efficiency) and the result is a decomposition rather than a pile of
  ablations. The module is deliberately just the combinatorics: the caller
  supplies `evaluate(selection) -> float`, and it never fits a model, touches a
  frame, or decides what "permissive" means. `k` is capped (`max_components`,
  default 12 — 4096 evaluations) and refused above it rather than quietly taking
  exponential time.
- **`Pipeline.audit()` / `Pipeline.causalize()`** front the compiler at the
  pipeline level. A step opts into expression-level auditing by implementing
  `leakage_exprs()` (and `with_leakage_exprs()` to accept the rewrite); a step
  that does not is audited from its declared `panel_safe` / `leakage_safe`
  attributes instead, which is a weaker check and is reported as such.
  `audit` returns a `PipelineAudit` of per-step `StepAudit`s; `causalize`
  returns a **new** `Pipeline` and never mutates the original, and fails closed
  rather than handing back a partially-corrected object.
- **`.over(entity)` carries no `order_by`.** The serialised tree made this
  visible: Polars' `Over` node stores no time order, so every "within-entity"
  operation in the library — ours included — is correct only if the frame
  happens to be sorted. `AGENTS.md` has always stated that precondition and
  nothing enforced it. The compiler injects `order_by=time` when the `time` key
  is given and refuses when it is not, rather than assuming sortedness.

**Limits, stated plainly.**

- v1's rule table knows 39 node kinds, and exactly **ten of them carry a
  rewrite**: the seven whole-column aggregates that become cumulative
  (`mean`, `sum`, `min`, `max`, `std`, `var`, `count`), the backward fill
  strategy, the centred rolling window, and the `.over` that gains an
  `order_by`. The other 29 are classify-only — safe leaves like `Column`,
  `Cast` and `BinaryExpr`, and refusals like `Rank`, `Interpolate`, a negative
  `Shift`, a reversed `CumSum` and `EwmMean`. Everything not in the table is
  refused, not approved. This is a rule table, not a verifier for arbitrary
  Python.
- The serialised expression tree is **not** a stable public Polars API; Polars
  promises nothing about it across versions. The rule table is therefore pinned
  to the Polars minors it has been tested against — 1.44 today — and the
  serialise/deserialise round trip runs on every call, even when nothing is
  rewritten, so format drift surfaces as a loud error naming the tested versions
  rather than as a silently unrewritten expression. A format change costs you
  refusals, never a silent pass.
- `map_batches` and `map_elements` are opaque and are **always** refused. The
  escape hatch is the operator registry: a `FeatureSpec` already carries
  `panel_safe` / `leakage_safe`, so a registered op is a trusted leaf. That is
  what stops the compiler refusing Panelary's own `map_batches`-based operators.
- Rewrites that are causal but not numerically identical to the original — an
  expanding quantile is not the global quantile — are **off by default** and
  require `allow_approximate=True`. A rewrite should not silently change
  results.

### Fixed

- **`sliding_window_split` trained on future data.** `cross_validation`'s
  sliding splitter computed its training offset as
  `pl.len() - cutoff - window_size`. When the window exceeded the history
  available before the first test block that offset went negative, and a
  negative Polars slice offset counts back from the *end* of the group — so the
  earliest folds trained on rows that came *after* their own test block. On a
  20-step panel with `test_size=2, n_splits=5, step_size=3, window_size=10`,
  fold 0 tested `t=6..7` and trained on `t=16..19`. This violated the
  `panel_safe` contract in a public splitter and was untested: the existing
  leakage suite only exercised the panel-aware variants. The window is now
  clamped at the start of history. Expanding-window slicing is unchanged.
- **`panelary.metrics.multi_objective` was unreachable.** It had its own
  documented API page while `hasattr(pn.metrics, "multi_objective")` was
  `False`. Now re-exported, with `Metrics`, `score_forecast`, `score_backtest`
  and `summarize_scores` available from `panelary.metrics` directly.
- **The shipped `xs.pyi` stub hid five of seven `.xs` methods.** The package
  ships `py.typed`, so `pl.col("ret").xs.zscore()` — documented and carrying a
  FeatureSpec — was a type error for every user. `rank` also declared
  `column: str` where the runtime takes `columns: str | Sequence[str]`. The
  stub is regenerated from the runtime signatures and `tests/test_namespace_stubs.py`
  now fails the build on drift.
- **`make typecheck` could not run on Python 3.12+.** `python_version = "3.10"`
  also selects mypy's parser, which then rejects numpy's own PEP 695 stubs and
  aborts before checking anything. CI hid this by pinning 3.10 for that job
  while the package supports 3.10–3.13.
- `tests/test_dependency_drift.py` silently collected **zero** tests on the
  three Python 3.10 CI legs: its `pytest.importorskip("tomli")` sat at module
  scope and `tomli` was declared in no extra. Now in `dev`.
- Two stale entries in CI's bare-core `--ignore` list. `tests/test_plotting.py`
  guards itself with `importorskip`, and `tests/test_cross_validation.py`
  imports no optional dependency — dropping it restores 264 tests of bare-core
  coverage. `pytest --ignore` accepts a non-existent path silently, so
  `tests/test_ci_guardrails.py` now asserts every listed path exists.
- A `See Also` in `core/model_selection` claimed its splitters "thinly wrap"
  the `cross_validation` originals. They do not — they are a separate
  implementation on a different axis. Only the fold schedule, which is provably
  identical, is now shared via `_walk_forward_cutoffs`.

### Changed

- **Internal layout only — no public import path changes.** The loose private
  top-level modules were folded into a single `panelary/_internal/` package and
  two private helpers moved next to the code that owns them. Nothing here was
  ever part of the documented public API, and every `pn.*` / `panelary.<public>`
  import is unchanged; the note exists so that older docs, plans and branches
  can be re-pointed:

  | Was | Is now |
  | --- | --- |
  | `panelary/_compat.py` | `panelary/_internal/_compat.py` |
  | `panelary/_numpy_stats.py` | `panelary/_internal/_numpy_stats.py` |
  | `panelary/_progress.py` | `panelary/_internal/_progress.py` |
  | `panelary/_utils.py` | `panelary/_internal/_utils.py` |
  | `panelary/_deps.py` | `panelary/_internal/_deps.py` |
  | `panelary/_ffd.py` | `panelary/_internal/_ffd.py` |
  | `panelary/_verbs.py` | `panelary/_internal/_verbs.py` |
  | `panelary/ranges.py` | `panelary/_internal/_ranges.py` |
  | `panelary/type_aliases.py` | `panelary/_internal/_type_aliases.py` |
  | `panelary/conversion.py` | `panelary/forecasting/_conversion.py` |

  The documented `require()` convention is therefore now
  `from panelary._internal._deps import require` (was `panelary._deps`), and
  `panelary._ffd.estimate_ffd_order` — announced under 0.5.0 — is reached as
  `panelary.econ.features.estimate_ffd_order`.

  **Five public modules became packages.** `feature_extractors` (3487 lines),
  `preprocessing` (1321), `catch22` (1066), `conformal` (663) and `plotting`
  (which absorbed the private `_plotting`) are now packages split into private
  submodules. `X.py` → `X/__init__.py` preserves the import path exactly, so
  every `from panelary.X import ...`, `pn.X.Y` and mkdocstrings `::: panelary.X`
  is unchanged — this is not a rename and needs no shim. The package root went
  from 24 loose modules to 9, all of them documented public API.

- Duplicated implementations collapsed onto single kernels, each proved
  equivalent before the merge: CAFE imputation (two implementations, two
  `_require_cafe`, one of which bypassed the `require()` convention with a bare
  `import cafe`) and cross-sectional neutralization (the `PanelTransformer` and
  the `.xs` expression namespace ran the same per-date `lstsq` with no shared
  code; verified bit-identical across 50 input/flag combinations first).

- `_ffd.py` reached up into `panelary.econ` through a deferred import — the sole
  cause of a latent import cycle. `estimate_ffd_order` moved to the module whose
  maths it already called; the leaf now has zero intra-package imports.

### Removed

- `panelary/metrics/probabilistic.py`, a zero-byte module imported by nothing.
- `tests/test_changepoint_detection.py`, which imported nothing from `panelary`
  and asserted on the output of a CUSUM it defined inline.
- `conftest`'s `dunnhumby_retail` fixture: no test referenced it and it raised
  on load (`f64` → `i16` cast of NaN). Its only data file, `data/dunnhumby.parquet`
  (20 MB), is untracked as a result.
- A dead `FUNCTIME__TEST_MODE` branch in `conftest` calling `DataFrame.groupby`,
  removed in Polars 1.0 — it would have raised had the variable ever been set.
- **104 MB of unreferenced parquet** untracked from `data/` (the full-size `m5`
  train/test frames — only the `_sample` variants are ever loaded — plus
  `m4_1h_*` and `tourism`), and **22 MB of unreferenced images** from `docs/img`.
  Note this does not shrink the 235 MiB pack: untracking is not a history
  rewrite, and that decision has not been made.
- The docs site advertised a **third party's Discord** on every page, inherited
  verbatim from functime, with a second such link in the contributing guide.
  Both removed; the notebook-download block in the theme override is kept.
- The retired `PanelKit` alias `pk` survived in shipped docstrings and two test
  modules. Now `pn` throughout, per the stated convention.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-09-09

The rename to **Panelary**, and the largest feature round so far: five design plans
implemented together. Four new capability pillars land (`detect`, `explain`,
`validation`, `econ`, plus factor extraction in `reduce`), a top-level verb API goes
in front of them, two long-standing numerical bugs are closed, and the light-core
gains from 0.4.0 are locked behind CI guardrails. No change to the mandatory
footprint: `[project.dependencies]` is still exactly `{numpy, polars}`.

### Changed — BREAKING: renamed to `panelary`

- **The import path and the PyPI distribution are both now `panelary`.**
  `import polars_features` and `pip install polars-features` no longer reach this
  project. The brand is Panelary; the canonical alias in the docs is
  `import panelary as pn`.
- **No compatibility shim ships, and none is planned.** A forwarding
  `polars_features` package would advertise a compatibility that has never been
  true. The last release on PyPI under the old name was `polars-features` 0.1.7 — a
  maintained fork of functime, with none of the panel API. 0.2.x, 0.3.x and 0.4.0
  were never published to PyPI under any name, so there is no released
  `polars_features` surface to forward to. See [MIGRATING.md](MIGRATING.md).
- **The public attribution hook is renamed `panelkit_shap_values` →
  `panelary_shap_values`.** This is the one rename that can break code you wrote:
  if you implemented that hook on a custom model so `explain.TreeAttributor` would
  pick it up, rename the method. It affects people tracking a git ref only — the
  hook never appeared in a PyPI release.
- **The test-guard environment overrides are renamed `PANELKIT_*` → `PANELARY_*`**:
  `PANELARY_IMPORT_BUDGET_MS`, `PANELARY_WHEEL_BUDGET_MB`, `PANELARY_DETECT_STRICT`.
- The repository, documentation site and package metadata all move to the
  `panelary` name.

### Added — a top-level verb API

- The capability pillars are now reachable as top-level verbs on the package:
  `pn.impute`, `pn.select`, `pn.features`, `pn.bubbles`, `pn.cluster`,
  `pn.regression`, `pn.causal` and `pn.reduce`. The underlying subpackages remain
  importable and unchanged; the verbs are a shorter front door, not a replacement.
  See the API reference for signatures.

### Added — `detect`: causal bubble, regime and changepoint detection

A fifth capability pillar. Every statistic is a function of data up to `t` and
nothing after it: recomputing a feature with more data appended returns the
**bitwise identical** value, asserted across fifteen expanding cut points and
every public entry point.

- **`bsadf_sequence` / `bsadf_panel`** — the backward sup-ADF (Phillips, Shi &
  Yu 2015). Built on a prefix-sum sufficient-statistic engine (`cumulative_moments`,
  `window_adf`): every one of the `~T²/2` nested windows costs `O(1)` to assemble,
  and `SSR = s − β̂'b` removes the residual pass entirely. `T = 1000` exhaustive
  (452,676 windows) in **~0.02 s of pure NumPy**, against 0.78 s for the fastest
  published C++ implementation, which is still `O(T³)` because it forms residuals
  in its inner loop. Agreement with per-window OLS: 1e-14.
- **`mc_table`** — one-pass nested critical values. On a driftless null the BSADF
  sequence is itself point-in-time, so paths nest and one simulation yields `cv[t]`
  for every `t`; draws are time-major so a wider table slices bitwise to a narrower
  one. Reproduces the published finite-sample 95% GSADF value at `T = 400`,
  `r0 = 0.10` as **2.2197**. A shipped fixed-point table serves the default call in
  0.4 ms, fingerprint-guarded against kernel drift.
  `kurozumi_boundary` and `training_max_cv` simulate nothing at all.
- **`focus`** — functional-pruning CUSUM: provably equivalent to running Page's
  CUSUM at every magnitude and every window length at once, no tuning parameter,
  `O(log n)` amortised. Exact against brute-force GLR (0.0), 100k points in 0.075 s.
- **`page_cusum`** in closed form (Lindley's recursion is a reflection, so it is two
  cumulative aggregations — `page_cusum_expr` gives the Polars expression),
  `shiryaev_roberts` in log space, `hb_cusum` with an analytic Chu–Stinchcombe–White
  boundary, `end_of_sample_S`, and one-sided `spot_variance` / `volatility_rescale`.
- **`breadth`, `residualise`, `panel_features`** — cross-sectional aggregation by
  participation rather than by mean, and backward-looking factor residualisation
  with betas frozen at `t`.

Deliberately refused: full-sample `GSADF` as a per-row feature, and episode peak /
end / duration. `min_window` is a required absolute integer — the conventional
`⌊T(0.01 + 1.8/√T)⌋` rule revises 41.2% of already-published cells when the sample
grows. No bootstrap critical values ship, because the standard wild bootstrap fits
its null on the whole sample.

### Added — `reduce`: leak-safe latent factor extraction

- `PCAFactors`, `HFAFactors`, `ICAFactors`, `RobustPCAFactors` plus the
  `pca_factors` / `hfa_factors` / `ica_factors` / `robust_pca_factors` functional
  cores. All emit `factor_1..r` columns from train-fit, sign-fixed loadings.
- **HFA** (higher-order multi-cumulant factor analysis), `order=3|4` — eigenanalysis
  of a cumulant matrix rather than the covariance matrix, recovering weak and
  Gaussian-masked non-Gaussian factors where PCA fails. Pure NumPy, with a blocked
  accumulation path (`block_rows=`) bounding peak memory at O(block·n) and a hard row
  guard. Clean-room from the published equations. `order=4` applies an Isserlis-derived
  Gaussian correction (`3·tr(S²)S² + 6·S⁴`) — without it the order-4 matrix is a
  polynomial in the covariance and merely re-finds the masking factor.
- Shared factor-count selectors `n_factors` / `bai_ng` (Bai–Ng IC_p1, IC_p2) /
  `eigenvalue_ratio` (Ahn–Horenstein). `n_factors=None` resolves on training rows only.

### Added — `explain`: leak-safe, panel-aware feature attribution

- `TimeAwareBackground` makes the SHAP reference set a fold-bound, past-only
  (`t' < t`, optional embargo), deterministically sampled, auditable object —
  closing the background-set leak that every other SHAP library leaves open.
- `TreeAttributor` (`PanelTransformer`, `panel_safe`/`leakage_safe`) dispatches to the
  models' own exact native TreeSHAP (XGBoost/LightGBM/CatBoost) and emits
  `shap_<feature>` columns keyed by `(entity, time)`, or a tidy long frame.
  `.check_efficiency()` verifies `E[f] + Σφ = f(x)` on the raw margin scale.
- Panel-native aggregation: `group_shap` (additive, exact) vs `joint_group_shap`
  (groups as coalition players), and `window_shap` on each entity's own calendar.
- `attribution_stability` / `background_sensitivity` / `attribution_drift` separate
  reference-induced oscillation from genuine regime drift.
- `interaction_values` / `interaction_matrix`: any-order Shapley interactions via
  `shapiq` interop (`max_order=k`).
- Custom models can supply their own exact attributions through the
  `panelary_shap_values` hook (renamed from `panelkit_shap_values`, see above).
- New optional extra `explain` (`shap`, `shapiq`). The `TreeAttributor` fast path
  needs neither.

### Added — `validation`: the honest validation & selection layer

- CPCV backtest-path reconstruction, purged walk-forward and conformal-calibration
  splits, Probabilistic/Deflated Sharpe, PBO, Romano-Wolf stepdown (FWER),
  Benjamini-Hochberg/Yekutieli (FDR), Diebold-Mariano (HAC + Harvey-Leybourne-Newbold),
  Hansen's SPA, the Model Confidence Set, CRPS/pinball/interval score/PIT, and
  moving-block/circular/stationary/wild/sieve bootstraps that never resample across a
  fold boundary. Pure NumPy + Polars — SPA and MCS are implemented natively rather than
  wrapped from `arch`, so the fold-boundary guarantee extends to them.
- `conformal`: time-series conformal prediction — ACI (Gibbs-Candès), Conformal-PID,
  NexCP and CQR, plus `conformal_calibration_split` so the calibration block is purged
  and embargoed. Coverage now holds under drift where naive split conformal collapses
  (0.89 vs 0.52 on a volatility ramp).

### Added — `econ`: panel & time-series econometrics

- **HDFE** — N-way fixed-effect absorption by alternating projections (Gaure/reghdfe)
  with classical, HC1, one-way and two-way (Cameron-Gelbach-Miller) clustered and
  Driscoll-Kraay standard errors; matches dense dummy-variable OLS to machine precision.
  `HDFETransformer` emits leak-controlled partialled-out features.
- **Heterogeneous panels** — Mean Group, Pesaran CCE-MG/CCEP and Pooled Mean Group,
  plus LLC / IPS / CIPS panel unit-root tests and the Pesaran CD test. Critical values
  are simulated from the estimator pipeline itself, not tabulated.
- **Fama-MacBeth** — per-date cross-sectional regression with Newey-West standard
  errors; winsorising and standardising are per-date, never global.
- **Diebold-Yilmaz connectedness** — generalised-FEVD spillover networks over a rolling
  VAR; total/directional/net connectedness as cross-entity features. Clean-room.
- **IVX** — predictive-regression inference that stays correctly sized under
  near-unit-root, endogenous predictors (5.6–7.1% empirical size at nominal 5%, vs
  8–27% for OLS); the IVX-Wald statistic doubles as a screening score (`IVXSelector`).
- **Double ML** — cross-fitted partially-linear DML over Panelary's purged and embargoed
  splitters, plus post-double-selection LASSO with the rigorous (plug-in) penalty.

### Added — `econ.features`: causal econometric feature generators

- Unit-root battery (ADF/KPSS/PP/DF-GLS/Ng-Perron/Zivot-Andrews with embedded
  critical-value tables), GPH & local-Whittle long-memory estimators, HAR-RV /
  bipower / jumps, Nelson-Siegel(-Svensson) curve factors, Amihud/Roll/Amivest
  liquidity, EVT Hill/POT-GPD VaR-ES, and a causal (trailing-window) seasonal-trend
  decomposition. A two-sided STL leaks and is deliberately not offered.
- `StationarityDifferencer`, `AutoFracDiff`, `HARModel`, `NelsonSiegel` and
  `CausalSeasonalDecomposer` — `PanelTransformer`s that learn on train and freeze.
- `panelary._ffd.estimate_ffd_order` — data-driven fractional-differencing
  order, wiring the long-memory estimators into the existing frac-diff filter.

### Added — the "interactions" theme

- `docs/concepts/interactions.md`: the shared functional-decomposition narrative tying
  `reduce`/HFA (higher-order structure in the *data*, `order=k`) to `explain`/Shapley
  interactions (higher-order structure in the *model*, `max_order=k`).

### Added — packaging guardrails

- Import-hygiene, dependency-drift and wheel-shape/size tests
  (`tests/test_import_hygiene.py`, `test_dependency_drift.py`,
  `test_wheel_guardrails.py`), plus a CI extras matrix that installs `[]`,
  `[recommended]` and `[all]` and runs the suite in each. Measured: 85 ms import,
  0.46 MB wheel. The budgets are overridable with `PANELARY_IMPORT_BUDGET_MS` and
  `PANELARY_WHEEL_BUDGET_MB`.
- `benchmarks/bench_hotspots.py` (ranked per-operation profile) and
  `benchmarks/show_capabilities.py` (optional-feature probe).
- `_numpy_stats.chebyshev_neighbour_counts`: exact, SciPy-free L-inf neighbour counts,
  so `sample_entropy` / `approximate_entropy` now work on the bare numpy+polars core
  (SciPy stays the faster backend when installed). Bare-core `test_tsfresh.py` went
  from 8 failed / 221 passed to 229 passed.

### Changed

- catch22 is 1.2×–2.0× faster (bit-exact): the remaining Python scans in
  `FC_LocalSimple_*`, `SB_MotifThree`, `SB_TransitionMatrix`, `_longest_run`,
  `CO_FirstMin_ac`, `CO_f1ecac`, `PD_PeriodicityWang` and `DN_OutlierInclude_*`
  are vectorised.
- k-Shape clustering is 4×–9× faster to fit and 8×–14× faster to score (bit-exact):
  forward FFTs are computed once per series/centroid instead of once per pair.
- `reduce.CrossSectionalPCA.transform` is 1.3×–2.0× faster (one array conversion
  instead of one per date).
- The test suite runs with `-n auto --dist loadfile` in CI and `make test`:
  **15+ minutes serial → 67 seconds** on 8 cores (1585 passed, 8 pre-existing
  failures in `tests/test_cusum_pure.py`). Those 8 were resolved later in the
  same cycle: their Rust-parity baselines had been captured from the extension
  removed in 0.4.0 and cannot be regenerated, so they now skip with that reason
  rather than fail. The file stands at 4 passed, 6 skipped.
- The mypy job no longer pretends. It reported ~1040 errors while configured as
  a hard gate, so it had never passed; it now ratchets against a baseline and
  fails only when the count rises.
- Every CI job has a `timeout-minutes`.
- `make check` runs lint, type-check and tests as one command.
- CI/release workflows dropped the dead Rust/maturin steps; releases now build a
  single universal `py3-none-any` wheel.
- Documentation is published by CI. GitHub Pages had never been enabled and the
  declared `site_url` returned 404; `docs/CNAME` pointed at `docs.functime.ai`,
  a domain this project does not control.

### Fixed

- **`pn.detect` raised `AttributeError`.** `detect` — 0.4.0's headline feature,
  37 public symbols — was never added to the package `__init__.py`. Nine
  modules were unreachable in total (`detect`, `forecasting`, `llm`, `metrics`,
  `backtesting`, `conformal`, `cross_validation`, `evaluation`, `plotting`);
  seven more resolved only by import side-effect and were absent from
  `__all__`. All are now reachable, and `tests/test_public_api.py` fails the
  build if a public subpackage is ever left unwired again.
- **`panelary.backtesting` could not be imported by any path.** A cycle
  (`backtesting` → `forecasting._reduction` → `forecasting/__init__` →
  `elite` → `backtesting`) meant every import of it raised `ImportError`.
  `forecasting/elite.py` now imports `backtest` inside the function that uses
  it, matching the pattern `base/forecaster.py` already used.
- **Broken `pip install` hints.** `forecasting/__init__` advertised the extras
  `lgb`, `cat` and `xgb`; none exist (the real names are `lightgbm`,
  `catboost`, `xgboost`), so following the hint produced "no matches found".
  Those names were also bound to an `ImportError` *instance*, making
  `fc.lightgbm` a value rather than something that raised, so failures
  surfaced later as a confusing "not callable" `TypeError`.
- **`import panelary.llm` required an API key.** The OpenAI client was
  constructed at module scope and raised `ValueError` when `OPENAI_API_KEY`
  was unset. It is now built on first use, and the module's imports route
  through `_deps.require` like every other optional dependency (its old hint,
  `polars_features[llm]`, was not a pasteable distribution name — under the new
  name the import name and the distribution name coincide, so the whole class of
  mistake is gone).
- `panelary/forecasting/elite.py` no longer imports scikit-learn at
  module scope, which was defeating the light-core guarantee that the extras
  matrix exists to defend.
- **frac-diff divergence** (one of two known numerical bugs): `ffd_weights` now rejects
  `d < 0`, whose binomial weights are not summable and made the truncated fixed-width
  filter diverge — at `d=-0.5` it ran to the 100 000-term safety cap and nulled every
  row of a normal-length series. Two further defects found in the same function:
  `max_width` was checked *after* appending (so `max_width=1` returned two weights),
  and a legal `d` with an unreachable `threshold` silently returned a 100 000-tap
  kernel instead of raising. Regression tests carry hand-computed golden weights.
- **Deflated Sharpe `N`/`V`** (the second known bug): the formula itself was verified
  correct against Bailey & López de Prado (2014) and pinned with independently computed
  golden values. The real defect was the `(N, V)` *pairing* in `_reconstruct_paths`,
  which combined the user's trial count `N` with the variance of one strategy's CPCV
  path Sharpes as a proxy for `V`. `cross_validate` / `validate.cpcv` now accept
  `trial_sharpes=`, deriving both from the same sample.
- **catch22 is now SciPy-independent.** `catch22.PD_PeriodicityWang_th0_01` returned
  *different values* depending on whether SciPy was installed: its
  `LSQUnivariateSpline` detrend degraded silently to a zero spline on the bare core
  (140.0 → 0.0 on a 512-point random walk). The least-squares cubic spline is now
  fitted in pure NumPy (`catch22._lsq_spline_fit`, a Cox-de Boor B-spline design
  matrix + `lstsq`), matching SciPy to ~1e-14 over n = 8..2048 and reproducing every
  SciPy-captured golden value exactly. All 24 features now compute on numpy + polars
  alone.
- **The README quickstart documented a library that was never shipped.** None of
  `pk.col(...)`, `pk.transform.winsorize`, `pk.models.lgbm_classifier` or
  `pk.model_selection.validate.cpcv` exists, and the sample used a
  `.panel.pct_change` method that does not exist and passed
  `triple_barrier(max_holding="10d")` where the real parameter is an integer.
  The quickstart has been replaced with one that was actually executed against
  the package.
- **The canonical alias is now `pn`.** `import panelary as pn` is used
  consistently across the README, every documentation page, `llms.txt`,
  `AGENTS.md` and the site. The old `pk` alias was short for the pre-launch
  codename and is retired.
- **README badges advertised Python 3.8+**; `pyproject.toml` requires `>=3.10`.
  The badges now match the metadata.
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md` described a project that no longer exists** — "Rust +
  Polars under the hood", with a `src/` directory of Rust kernels to contribute
  to. There is no `src/`, and the package has been pure Python since 0.4.0.

### Removed

- The `signatures` extra (documented RESERVED/UNUSED; its only reference
  anywhere was the `_deps` mapping), the `rust` keyword and the `maturin` dev
  dependency (no Rust extension since 0.4.0), the dead `[tool.hypothesis]`
  block (Hypothesis does not read `pyproject.toml`, so `deadline = 0` had no
  effect), a tracked 4.5 MB pre-0.4.0 Windows wheel, and `functime_rename.py`
  (a one-shot fork-migration script that rewrote every `.py` in the repo).
- The dangling `narwhals` → `interop` row in `_deps._MODULE_TO_EXTRA` (the `interop`
  extra went away in 0.4.0) and the corresponding docs entry.
- **Third-party analytics on the documentation site.** The site was reporting to a
  Google Analytics property (`G-CYGTL9FJ4R`) that belongs to the upstream functime
  docs and was inherited wholesale in the original import commit — it was never
  ours, and readers were being measured by someone else. Analytics is now disabled.

### Deferred

Every milestone that assumed a compiled extension was dropped, since 0.4.0 ships a
pure-Python wheel: the native Arrow/Polars TreeSHAP kernel and the sparse
Möbius/Fourier (SPEX) engine (`explain` M6/M7), the Rust HFA cumulant contraction
(`reduce` M6), vendoring the `tsecon` crates and its golden-fixture CI harness
(econometrics M7), and `augurs`-backed MSTL. DCC-GARCH, vine copulas and Bayesian
VAR/FAVAR remain out of scope by design.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-09-04

*Never published to PyPI.* A "light package" release: a numpy + polars core,
~10× faster import, and a pure-Python distribution (the Rust extension is gone).
Two **breaking** structural changes are called out below.

### Changed — BREAKING: slim hard dependencies

- **`pip install polars-features` now installs only `numpy` + `polars`.**
  `scikit-learn`, `scipy`, `flaml`, `holidays`, and `tqdm` moved out of the hard
  dependencies into optional extras (`ml`, `scipy`, `forecasting`, `seasonality`,
  `progress`). Feature code imports them lazily via `polars_features._deps.require`,
  which raises a single actionable `pip install 'polars-features[<extra>]'` message
  when one is missing. **To restore the previous batteries-included behavior:**
  `pip install 'polars-features[recommended]'` (ml + scipy + seasonality + cafe) or
  `[all]`.

### Changed — BREAKING: pure-Python distribution (Rust extension removed)

- **The compiled Rust extension (`src/`, Cargo, maturin) has been removed.** Panelary
  now ships as a single universal `py3-none-any` wheel — no compiler, no per-platform
  wheels, trivial installs everywhere. An audit found the crate was net-negative: its
  fractional-differencing kernel was already dead, its least-squares kernel was 35–500×
  *slower* than numpy, and Lempel–Ziv showed no gain. The only real win was CUSUM, now
  reimplemented in pure Python with an optional `numba` fast-path via the new `fast`
  extra (`pip install 'polars-features[fast]'`). Build backend switched maturin → hatchling.

### Changed — packaging & lighter import

- **Lighter `import polars_features`.** `scipy`, `scikit-learn`, and `cloudpickle`
  are no longer imported at `import polars_features` time; heavy back-ends are now
  loaded lazily at first use via `polars_features._deps.require(...)`, which raises a
  single actionable `pip install 'polars-features[<extra>]'` hint when a dependency
  is missing.
- **Dropped `cloudpickle`** from the hard dependencies — the only use (persisting a
  fitted sklearn regressor in the deseasonalize/reseasonalize path) is now handled by
  the stdlib `pickle` module. No functional change; the serialized objects are
  top-level library classes that `pickle` round-trips identically.

### Added — optional extras

- New named extras so users and tools can already target slim installs and so the
  `require(...)` install hints resolve to real extras:
  `ml` (`scikit-learn`), `scipy`, `progress` (`tqdm`), `seasonality` (`holidays`),
  `forecasting` (`flaml` + `tqdm`), `automl` (`flaml[automl]` + `lightgbm`),
  `lightgbm`, `catboost`, `xgboost`, and `ann` (`pylance`, for the `forecasting.lance`
  ANN reduction).
- The booster / ANN extras (`lightgbm`, `catboost`, `xgboost`, `ann`) previously did
  not exist even though `forecasting` error messages pointed at them — this makes
  `pip install 'polars-features[lightgbm]'` (etc.) actually work.
- `recommended` extra — a batteries-included bundle (`ml` + `scipy` + `seasonality`
  + `cafe`) that reproduces the old effective feature set for users who want
  `pip install` to "just work".
- Refreshed the `all` extra to union every real optional feature set.

### Removed

- Dead `interop` extra (`narwhals`) — `narwhals` is not imported anywhere in the
  package (it is only duck-typed in comments).

### Notes

- The `signatures` extra (`iisignature`) is retained but **reserved/unused** — no
  code imports `iisignature` yet and its license must be verified before it is
  advertised. (Removed outright in 0.5.0.)

## [0.3.0] — 2026-09-04

*Never published to PyPI.* Unsupervised toolkit (clustering, dimensionality
reduction, unsupervised feature selection) ported leak-safely from the Sov.ai SDK,
plus a cross-sectional/factor evaluation layer and four confirmed correctness fixes.
Every learned method fits on the training fold only; genuinely offline methods are
gated behind `leakage_safe=False`.

### Added — clustering (`polars_features.cluster`)

- `KShapeClusterer` — leak-safe k-Shape time-series clustering (FFT normalized
  cross-correlation + Shape-Based Distance), centroids learned on train and frozen;
  emits per-`(entity, time)` distance columns + a hard label; static / expanding /
  fixed-window modes. Pure-NumPy engine, no torch.
- `CrossSectionalClusterer` — clusters entities by their same-date feature vectors
  (KMeans / agglomerative), scaler fit on train only.
- Public utilities `sbd`, `ncc`, `k_from_n_entities`.

### Added — dimensionality reduction (`polars_features.reduce`)

- `PanelPCA` and `PanelSVD` / `PanelFactorAnalysis` / `PanelRandomProjection` /
  `PanelKernelPCA` / `PanelNMF` — leak-safe reducers (scaler + rotation + auto
  `n_components` fit on train only, deterministic component sign-fixing).
- `StatisticalFactors` — K statistical factors from a returns panel (train-fit
  loadings); `scope="global"` is gated `leakage_safe=False`.
- `CrossSectionalPCA` — per-date cross-sectional reduction.
- Optional `PanelUMAP` via the new `dimreduce` extra (`umap-learn`).

### Added — unsupervised feature selection (`polars_features.select`)

- `pfa` / `PFASelector` — Principal Feature Analysis (PCA loadings clustered, one
  representative feature per cluster; unsupervised, complements `mrmr`).
- `variance`, `correlation`, `select_top`, `projection_importance`, and
  `VarianceSelector` / `CorrelationSelector` transformers.

### Added — cross-sectional / factor evaluation (`polars_features.factor`)

- `forward_return` — the single audited, leak-safe forward-return aligner
  (backward per-entity shift with a gap guard).
- `ic` / `ic_summary` — per-date information coefficient (rank / Pearson), ICIR, t-stat.
- `portfolio_sort` — per-date quantile buckets, long-short spread, monotonicity.
- `orthogonalize` — per-date feature-set de-correlation (Gram-Schmidt / QR).
- `.xs.standardize` and `.xs.rank(normalize="unit"|"centered"|"uniform")`.

### Fixed

- **Deflated Sharpe Ratio**: `cross_validate` / `validate.cpcv` no longer deflate
  against `n_paths` (CV geometry) with a fallback variance — they now take an explicit
  `n_trials` (warning + `n_paths` floor when omitted) and use the empirical
  cross-trial variance `V = var(path_sharpes, ddof=1)`. New NaN-safe, annualization-aware
  `_sharpe`; PBO can rank by Sharpe (`statistic="sharpe"`). (Superseded by the
  `trial_sharpes=` fix in 0.5.0.)
- **`select.mda`**: permutation is now within-entity by default
  (`permute_within="entity"`) instead of a global cross-entity/time shuffle that
  produced off-manifold rows and inflated importances.
- **Fractional differencing**: consolidated to a single `ffd_weights` / `frac_diff_expr`
  source of truth (`polars_features._ffd`); all five Python surfaces now agree bit-for-bit
  (parity-tested), removing the Rust `threshold=0.0` divergence from the Python path.
- **`preprocessing.impute`**: `bfill` / `interpolate` now emit a `LeakageWarning`
  (opt out with `allow_leaky=True`); steers users to the point-in-time CAFE path.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-09-02

*Never published to PyPI.* First cut of the Panelary panel core, plus the leak-safe
feature-engineering, labeling, and validation layer landing on top of the
functime-derived engine.

### Added — panel core (shipped in-repo, experimental)

- `PanelFrame` — typed, lazy view over a long-format `(entity, time, *features)` panel.
- Leak-safe `Pipeline` with sklearn ergonomics and `panel_safe` / `leakage_safe` contracts
  (`PanelTransformer` / `PanelEstimator`).
- `.panel` (per-entity, causal) and `.xs` (cross-sectional) Polars expression **and**
  frame-level namespaces, registered as an import side effect.
- Finance-grade, leak-safe cross-validation: `PurgedKFold` and `CombinatorialPurgedCV`
  (CPCV), plus panel-aware `expanding_window_split` / `sliding_window_split`
  (López de Prado, *Advances in Financial Machine Learning*).
- Backtest-overfitting metrics: `deflated_sharpe_ratio` and
  `probability_of_backtest_overfitting` (PBO via CSCV).

### Added — landing this release

- CAFE imputation: `cafe_impute` (`polars_features.preprocessing`) and `CafeImputer`
  (`polars_features.imputation`), powered by the optional `cafe-impute` dependency
  (MIT, Sov.ai) via the new `cafe` extra.
- Bulk `extract_features` (`polars_features.feature_extractors`).
- Cross-sectional `.xs` operations.
- Triple-barrier labeling: `triple_barrier` (`polars_features.label`).
- catch22 feature set (`polars_features.catch22`) — clean-room from Lubba et al. 2019.
- Leakage verifier `assert_no_lookahead` (`polars_features.testing`).
- CPCV runner: `cross_validate` / `validate` / `CVReport`
  (`polars_features.core.model_selection`).

### Changed

- Bumped version to `0.2.0` (past the live PyPI `polars-features` 0.1.7); aligned
  `Cargo.toml`.
- Fixed `__version__` (was functime's `0.9.5`) and the package docstring to describe
  the project.
- Top-level exports now use narrow `try/except ImportError` with a `warnings.warn`
  instead of blanket `contextlib.suppress(Exception)` (which silently hid real import bugs).
- Repositioned the project story: functime is **actively maintained**; Panelary interoperates
  with functime/Nixtla rather than replacing them. Corrected `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`,
  `NOTICE`, and docs.
- Packaging hygiene: removed the committed prebuilt wheel from git and ignore `*.whl`;
  fixed the stale `Makefile` (uninstall `polars_features`, `BASE ?= main`, `[dev]` extra);
  fixed user-facing `pip install functime[...]` strings to `polars_features[...]`.
- Documentation: mkdocstrings API pages now target `polars_features.*`; `mkdocs.yml`
  site/repo URLs point at the project's own locations.

## [0.1.x] — the "maintained functime" wedge

The 0.1 line is the only one that ever reached PyPI, and it did so under the name
**`polars-features`**: 0.1.0, 0.1.5, 0.1.6 and 0.1.7. It was a drop-in, *maintained*
functime with modern packaging — none of the panel API described above existed in it.
**0.1.7 is the last release under the old name**; there is no 0.1.8, and no
`polars_features` release will ever contain the current API.

### Added

- Verified compatibility with current Polars (`polars>=1.29`).
- Published wheels for Linux/macOS/Windows on supported Python versions.
- Green CI, test suite passing, reproducible builds.
- A rebranded documentation site retaining the functime API surface.
- A migration note for functime users (same APIs, new home).

### Notes

- Out of scope for the 0.1 line, and delivered later: `PanelFrame` / leak-safe
  `Pipeline` / CPCV / labeling and the full panel module taxonomy (0.2.0), the
  clean-room catch22 feature set (0.2.0), and the public package rename (0.5.0).

## [Phase 0] — modernization & foundation

Pre-0.1 groundwork, recorded for completeness.

### Added

- `NOTICE` file crediting functime as the upstream this work is derived from, with
  Apache-2.0 third-party notices and a clean-room statement for catch22 (reimplemented
  from Lubba et al. 2019, not vendored from GPL `pycatch22`).
- `llms.txt` discovery file (per the llms.txt convention) summarizing the project, its
  module taxonomy, and core concepts for coding agents.
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file).
- Own-branded documentation: `docs/quickstart.md` and `docs/leakage.md`
  (correctness-by-construction narrative).

### Changed

- Repositioned the project as a named product — "leak-safe, Rust-fast feature engineering
  and ML for panel data, built on Polars" — across `README.md`, `mkdocs.yml`, and docs.
  (The "Rust-fast" claim stopped being true in 0.4.0, which removed the extension.)
- Rewrote `README.md` with the product one-liner/tagline, prominent functime credit,
  install guidance (note: import name remains `polars_features`), a 60-second quickstart
  of the target panel API, an honest shipped-vs-roadmap table, and ecosystem positioning.
- Updated `mkdocs.yml` site name/description and navigation.
- Updated `CONTRIBUTING.md` to describe the Tier B/C (Python-first, low Rust barrier)
  contribution path, the `panel_safe`/`leakage_safe` contracts, and good-first-issue posture.

### Notes

- Infrastructure in progress at the time: modern packaging via `pyproject.toml`
  (maturin + abi3 wheels), CI and multi-platform wheel builds, and core panel protocol
  scaffolding (`PanelFrame`, leak-safe `Pipeline` contracts) in design phase.
- No public Python or Rust APIs were renamed in Phase 0; the package rename was
  deferred. It finally landed in 0.5.0, as `panelary`.
- The functime-derived engine (feature extractors, forecasting, preprocessing, seasonality,
  cross-validation, metrics, LLM analysis) was unchanged and remained importable from
  `polars_features`.
